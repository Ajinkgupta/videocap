# Remotion Captioning Platform — Assignment

Project: Remotion Captioning Platform

Goal
----
Build a hosted full-stack web application that allows users to upload an `.mp4` video, automatically generate captions (including Hinglish), preview them, and render/export the final captioned video using Remotion.

Core Requirements
-----------------
- Remotion integration for overlaying captions and rendering final MP4s.
- UI for uploading `.mp4` files.
- Auto-captioning via a speech-to-text provider (e.g., OpenAI Whisper API or AssemblyAI).
- Proper rendering of mixed Hindi (Devanagari) + English text using `Noto Sans` and `Noto Sans Devanagari`.
- At least 2–3 caption style presets (bottom-centered, top-bar, karaoke-style).
- Real-time preview using Remotion Player and an export/render path.
- Live deployment (Vercel, Render, or similar) with a public URL.

Deliverables
------------
- Live app URL
- GitHub repository with full source
- `README.md` with Node.js version, setup steps, run commands, caption generation details, and deployment instructions
- At least one sample video and its captioned MP4 result
- `assignment.md` (this file) and `steps.md` with implementation steps

Evaluation Criteria
-------------------
- Functional correctness and reliability
- Hinglish rendering quality and caption accuracy
- Code clarity and modularity
- UI/UX and ease of use
- Deployment and performance
